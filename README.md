Local + contextual news for communities

## The relevance of place
LOCALIZING is critical for people to understand their surroundings, and plays a large role in understanding events and their implications over time and space.

THE NEWS is a repository of human activity, rife with rich descriptions of WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW, and WHY things happen.

WE LACK the mans to leverage this information for better informed citizens, nuanced monitoring of news coverage, efficient city management, improved research methods, or informed GeoINT operations.

## Where we are
Publishers, governments and activism groups want to communicate information clearly to their readers to improve understanding and engagement... but interactive spatial data visualizations aren't easy for journalists to create or manage.

City users want to understand what is happening in their environment... but most articles don't include context maps, and the content of digital journals cannot yet be searched spatially or temporally.

Researchers, city managers, and GeoInt Operations want to be able to search and ingest high quality information from the news... but they cannot access these resources, nor do they have access to "briefings" on an area.

## What we face
Though the news industry is struggling to establish viable business models in the digital age, online news and social media are continuing to grow and displace other mediums.

A lack of clear and efficient transmission of information leads to misinformed citizens and city managers. Digital media agencies know the value of data visualizations for engaging readers.

Time, processing, and human resources are extended to scrape news and social media sites to extract event data for smart city and GeoINT applications.


## What we're doing
Apregoar provides tools for:
- Mapping news
- Contextualizing articles
- Spatial discovery and searching of relevant articles
- Whitelabeled integrations

COMPREHENSIVE: Allows association of multiple spatial/temporal events and/or contextual places per article.

REPRESENTATIVE: Nothing happens in zero dimensions. Instead of points, the tools allow the association of multi-polygons to represent places.

HIGH CONFIDENCE: Because the instances are tagged by contributor type, verified content data is much higher quality than the geoparsed results from scraped articles.

DYNAMIC: Connections to the data are available as each article is published, negating lag time for integration into other applications. Likewise, publisher revisions are reflected automatically and immediately.

## Collaborate
We're looking for stakeholders to help guide the next stages of development, and team members to realize the next steps.
